** On Euclid's Elements

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Euclid's Elements subsequently became the basis of all mathematical education, not only in the Roman and Byzantine periods, but right down to the mid-20th century, and it could be argued that it is the most successful textbook ever written.

You never can make a lawyer if you do not understand what demonstrate means; and I left my situation in Springfield, went home to my father's house, and stayed there till I could give any proposition in the six books of Euclid at sight.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
At the age of 12 I experienced a second wonder of a very different kind: a booklet dealing with Euclidean plane geometry that came into my hands at the beginning of a school year.

** Axioms of Euclidean Geometry

 1. To draw a straight line from any point to any point. \pause
 2. To produce [extend] a finite straight line continuously in a straight line. \pause
 3. To describe a circle with any centre and distance [radius]. \pause
 4. That all right angles are equal to one another. \pause
 5. The parallel postulate: That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which are the angles less than the two right angles.
