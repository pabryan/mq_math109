** On Euclid's Elements

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Euclid's Elements subsequently became the basis of all mathematical education, not only in the Roman and Byzantine periods, but right down to the mid-20th century, and it could be argued that it is the most successful textbook ever written.

You never can make a lawyer if you do not understand what demonstrate means; and I left my situation in Springfield, went home to my father's house, and stayed there till I could give any proposition in the six books of Euclid at sight.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
At the age of 12 I experienced a second wonder of a very different kind: a booklet dealing with Euclidean plane geometry that came into my hands at the beginning of a school year.

** Axioms of Euclidean Geometry

 1. To draw a straight line from any point to any point. \pause
 2. To produce [extend] a finite straight line continuously in a straight line. \pause
 3. To describe a circle with any centre and distance [radius]. \pause
 4. That all right angles are equal to one another. \pause
 5. *The parallel postulate*: That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which are the angles less than the two right angles.

** Axiom one

Given any line $L$ with endpoints $p, q$ there *exists* a line $L'$ with one end point $p$ and containing $q$ not as an endpoint. Extensions are *unique* in that if $L''$ is also an extension, either $L'$ lies on $L''$ or vice versa. Therefore there is a *unique* unbounded line $\bar{L}$ containing all such extensions.

** Axiom three

*Definition*: A right angle is the angle formed at the intersection of two lines such that all four angles are equal.

There *exists* right angles and they are *unique* up to congruence (translation and rotation).

Given any line $L$ and point $p$ not on $L$, there *exists* a *unique* line passing through $p$ and not intersecting $L$ (Playfair's axiom).

** Limitations of Euclid

- Many notions like extending lines, congruence, a point lying on a line etc. are not defined. \pause
- The axioms are supposed to determine everything through *logical deduction only*. Therefore we must be careful not to let our intuition of what geometric concepts are *supposed to mean* get in the way of rigorous deduction. \pause
- One must be able to say at all times--instead of points, straight lines, and planes--tables, chairs, and beer mugs -- David Hilbert

** Hilbert's Axioms for Solid Geometry

- Three /primitive/ notions:
  1. point
  2. line
  3. plane \pause
- Three /primitive/ relations:
  1. Betweeness of points
  2. Containment of points on lines, points on planes and lines on planes
  3. Congruence of lines, angles \pause
- 21 axioms (18 axioms for plane geometry) - 1 axiom is redundant
  - 8 (3) axioms of incidence: e.g any two points lie on a line
  - 4 (4) axioms of order: e.g. if a point lies between two other points, then all three points lie on a line
  - 6 (6) axioms of congruence: e.g. triangles with two congruent sides and a congruent angle are congruent
  - 1 (1) axiom of parallels: For any line $L$ and point $p$ not on the line, there is a unique parallel line $Q$ in the plane determined by $L$ and $a$
  - 2 (2) axioms of continuity: e.g. For a line $L = pq$, and a point $r$ on the line segment, there exists a natural number $n$ such that joining $pr$ contiguously $n$ times extends beyond $q$

** A Model for Euclidean Geometry - Descartes

The *plane*, \(P\) is the set of ordered pairs of real numbers: \(\{(x, y) : x, y \in \RR\}\). \pause

- *Points*: any such pair, eg. \((1, 0)\), \((100, -10^9)\), \((\pi, 1)\) etc. \pause
- *Lines*: sets of the form \(\{p + t q : t \in I \text{ an interval}\}\) with \(p,q\) points \pause
- *Circles*: sets of the form \(\{(x, y) : (x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2 = R^2, x_0, y_0 \in \RR, R > 0\}\) \pause
- *Right Angles*: \(p + tq, p + tr\) form a right angle at \(p\) if \(q \cdot r = 0\) where \(q \cdot r = q_1 r_1 + q_2 r_2\) and \(q = (q_1, q_2), r = (r_1, r_2)\).

** Descartes' Model Satisfies the Axioms

- Axiom 1: Given points, \(p, q\), our line is precisely \(\{p + t(q-p) : 0 \leq t \leq 1\}\). \pause
- Axiom 2: Given a line \(\{p + tq : a \leq t \leq b\}\), extend it by \(\{p + t q: a \leq t \leq b + 1\}\). \pause
- Axiom 3: Given a point \(p = (p_1, p_2)\), and \(R > 0\), just take \(\{(x, y) : (x-p_1)^2 + (y-p_2)^2 = R^2\}\) \pause
- Axiom 4: Given two right angles formed by \(\{p_1 + tq_1, p_1 + tr_1\}\) and \(\{p_2 + tq_2, p_2 + t_r2\}\) first translate:
  \[
  \tau: p \in P \mapsto p + p_1 - p_2 \Rightarrow \tau(p_2) = p_1
  \]
  then rotate so that
  \[
  r_2 \mapsto r_1.
  \]

** Descartes' Model Satisfies The Fifth Postulate

Take a line
\[
L = \{p + t q\}
\]
and a point
\[
r \notin L \text{ so that } r \ne p + t q \text{ for any } t
\]
\pause

For our parallel line, let
\[
L' = \{r + t q\}.
\]

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[height=0.4\textheight]{img/euclid_axiom5_descartes.png}
\end{figure}

** Descartes' Model Satisfies The Fifth Postulate

*Proof that \(L\) and \(L'\) are parallel*: Suppose \(L\) intersects \(L'\). Then there is a \(t_1\) and a \(t_2\) such that
\[
p + t_1 q = r + t_2 q.
\]
\pause

But then
\[
r = p + (t_1 - t_2) q \in L
\]
a contradiction.

** Descartes' Model Satisfies The Fifth Postulate

*Proof that \(L'\) is unique*

Let \(\bar{L} = r + t w\) be a line through \(r\) and not intersecting \(L'\). /Why can we assume it's of this form and not say \(u + t w\) with \(u \ne r\)?/ \pause

Let \(q^{\perp}\) satisfy \(q^{\perp} \cdot q = 0\) (by the fourth axiom \(q^{\perp}\) is unique up to scaling and reflection.) We may write uniquely,
\[
w = A q + B q^{\perp} \text{ for } A, B \in \RR.
\]
\pause
Then
\[
\bar{L} = \{r + t A q + t B q^{\perp}\}.
\]
\pause

To show \(\bar{L} = L'\) we show that \(B = 0\) since then
\[
L' = \{r + t q : t \in \RR\} = \{r + s A q : s \in \RR\} = \bar{L} \quad \text{ taking } t = A s.
\]

** Descartes' Model Satisfies The Fifth Postulate

To show \(B = 0\) we show that \(B \ne 0\) implies \(\bar{L}\) intersects \(L\). That is, there exists \(t_1, t_2\) such that
\[
p + t_1 q = r + t_2 w = r + t_2 A q + t_2 B q^{\perp}.
\]
\pause

In other words,
\[
r = p + (t_1 - A t_2) q - B t_2 q^{\perp}.
\]
\pause

Finally, then since \(r \notin L\), we have
\[
r = p + C q + D q^{\perp}, \quad D \ne 0.
\]
\pause

Then let
\[
t_1 = C - AD/B, \quad t_2 = -D/B.
\]
