** On Euclid's Elements

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Euclid's Elements subsequently became the basis of all mathematical education, not only in the Roman and Byzantine periods, but right down to the mid-20th century, and it could be argued that it is the most successful textbook ever written.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
You never can make a lawyer if you do not understand what demonstrate means; and I left my situation in Springfield, went home to my father's house, and stayed there till I could give any proposition in the six books of Euclid at sight.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
At the age of 12 I experienced a second wonder of a very different kind: a booklet dealing with Euclidean plane geometry that came into my hands at the beginning of a school year.

** Axioms of Euclidean Geometry

 1. To draw a straight line from any point to any point. \pause
 2. To produce [extend] a finite straight line continuously in a straight line. \pause
 3. To describe a circle with any centre and distance [radius]. \pause
 4. That all right angles are equal to one another. \pause
 5. *The parallel postulate*: That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which are the angles less than the two right angles.

** Axiom one

Given any two distinct points, there *exists* a *unique* straight line joining the two points.

** Axiom two

     :END:

Given any line $L$ with endpoints $p, q$ there *exists* a line $L'$ with one end point $p$ and containing $q$ not as an endpoint. Extensions are *unique* in that if $L''$ is also an extension, either $L'$ lies on $L''$ or vice versa. Therefore there is a *unique* unbounded line $\bar{L}$ containing all such extensions.

** Axiom three

Given any point $p$ and positive number $r$, there *exists* a *unique* circle centred on $p$ with radius $r$.

** Axiom four

*Definition*: A right angle is the angle formed at the intersection of two lines such that all four angles are equal.

There *exists* right angles and they are *unique* up to congruence (translation and rotation).

Given any line $L$ and point $p$ not on $L$, there *exists* a *unique* line passing through $p$ and not intersecting $L$.

** Hilbert's Axioms

- Three /primitive/ notions:
  1. point
  2. line
  3. plane \pause
- Three /primitive/ relations:
  1. Betweeness of points
  2. Containment of points on lines, points on planes and lines on planes
  3. Congruence of lines, angles \pause
- Twenty axioms
  - 8 axioms of incidence: e.g any two points lie on a line
  - 4 axioms of order: e.g. if a point lies between two other points, then all three points lie on a line
  - 6 axioms of congruence: e.g. triangles with two congruent sides and a congruent angle are congruent
  - 1 axiom of parallels: For any line $L$ and point $p$ not on the line, there is a unique parallel line $Q$ in the plane determined by $L$ and $a$
  - 2 axioms of continuity: e.g. For a line $L = pq$, and a point $r$ on the line segment, there exists a natural number $n$ such that joining $pr$ contiguously $n$ times extends beyond $q$
